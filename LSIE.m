% LSIE: A fast and secure Latin square-based image encryption scheme
% The current paper proposes LSIE, a fast and secure Latin square-based 
% image encryption scheme using SHA256 hash function and chaotic systems. 
% LSIE uses a 3-tier architecture consisting of diffusion-confusion-diffusion 
% based on Latin squares to design an efficient cryptographic algorithm. Firstly, 
% the initial values and parameters of the 3D exponent chaotic map (3D-ECM) is obtained 
% from the SHA256 hash value of the external secret key and the plain image. Next, 
% two orthogonal Latin squares are constructed using chaotic sequences generated by the 
% 3D-ECM. In the first diffusion phase, one of the Latin squares is considered as a key 
% image to Exclusive-OR (XOR) with the plain image. In the confusion phase, a 2D permutation 
% based on the orthogonal Latin squares is presented to permute pixel positions of 
% the diffused image. In the second diffusion phase, another Latin square is considered 
% as a key image to XOR with the permuted image. The analysis and simulation results 
% indicate that the proposed LSIE could efficiently resist common security attacks, 
% as also that it is a fast method for real-time applications. Keywords: Latin square, 
% Image encryption, SHA256, Chaotic system.
